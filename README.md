Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================	

Course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera


Here it is assumed that the dataset(zipped) is unzipped to the folder named gcd-dataset. The run_analysis.R script will be kept outside of that folder. The file names and paths to the files inside the gcd-dataset folder is assumed to be the same as in the original zip file.

This repo contains the following files
- **run_analysis.R**: the R script which does the processing on the dataset and comes up with the clean dataset as required by the project
- **CodeBook.md**: A code book which describes the variables, data and transformations involved in cleaning the data
- **README.md**: The file you are reading currently, which helps make sense of what the other files in the repository do.
